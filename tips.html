        <h1> “Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19” </h1>

        <div class="info">
            <p>
                As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
                feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. <br>  <br>
    
                Dr. Cardona explains. <br> <br> 
    
                “Fully vaccinated" means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
                protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
                protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
                exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” 
            </p>

            <p class="heading">
                <h1> 
                    Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, including other vaccinated people? 
                </h1> 
            </p>
               
            <p class="para">
                While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines. <br> <br> 
                “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”
